Hello world! As you can see on my profile, my name is Kevin Marques and I'm a Brazilian software developer that really loves technology and doing software. Currently, I'm studying to become a **full-stack developer** :sparkles: someday and this Github account is where I share my projects and contribuitions, hope you enjoy some of my work. Also, if you want some help, feel free to get in touch!

### More Detailed Information
I'm still studying some of the most important subjects in technology yet, but I'm happy to say that I'm comfortable enough to deal with **Docker images**, **SQL databases** and **Regex**. Besides coding, my hobbies include exploring new things -- I started learning **Spanish** recently --, writing articles on my personal blog and drawn manga, graffiti or other cool art styles.
